# Quantum-Computing-Shor-s-Algorithm
""Implement Shor's algorithm to find quantum counting bits' period.""
Design a quantum program that constructs a quantum phase estimation circuit for 𝑓(𝑥) = a𝑥 (mod 15) using c (2 ≤ c ≤ 8) quantum counting bits. Execute the quantum circuit using a quantum computer simulator to obtain measurement results of the quantum counting bits and determine the period of 𝑓(𝑥).
